# CS4774FinalProject_Akhtar_Faruqi_Sarnaik

This repository contains the contents of a final project authored by Ramiz Akhtar (rsa5wj@virginia.edu), Rayaan Faruqi (raf9dz@virginia.edu), and Kunaal Sarnaik (kss7yy@virginia.edu). The final project was assigned for Professor Yanjun Qi's CS 4774: Machine Learning course during the Fall 2020 Semester. The overarching goal of the project was to construct and train a deep convolutional neural network based on the DenseNet architecture in order to classify skin lesion images efficiently and accurately. The skin lesion images were provided by Kaggle user Pablo Lopez Santori (https://www.kaggle.com/wanderdust/skin-lesion-analysis-toward-melanoma-detection); the data set possessed 2,750 images total across three different classes: 1) Nevus (benign mole), 2) Melanoma Lesion, and 3) Seborrheic Keratosis Lesion.

The sub-directories in this repository are as follows: 1) Final_Project_Code, which contains the .py file that was utilized locally to preprocess data and configure paths, 2) Final_Project_WriteUps, which contains the published documents we were required to submit for the CS 4774 course, including but not limited to the final Jupyter notebook, project proposal, and presentation slides, and 3)
